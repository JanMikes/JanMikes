Hi, I am **Jan** 👋 PHP geek from Czech Republic.  
It has been over 20 years already, since I deployed my first web application!

I love to share my experience and talk about stuff like CI/CD, containers, TDD, DDD, PHP applications architecture and many more...

In my spare time, I am building [Peon](https://peon.dev). Open-source tool to automate your boring stuff - you can delegate things like coding standards, fixers and many more to Peon. You can as well choose from many predefined ready-to-use community maintained recipes to improve your codebase. Peon behaves just like your real colleague:

1. You: tell peon what to do (define custom tasks and/or pick recipes)
2. Peon: does the job, opens merge request
3. You: review & merge

Check out [Peon's Github](https://github.com/peon-dev/peon).
