Hi, I am **Jan** 👋 PHP geek from Czech Republic.  
It has been over 20 years already, since I deployed my first web application!

I love to share my experience and talk about stuff like CI/CD, containers, TDD, DDD, PHP applications architecture, automation, monorepos and many more... Because I highly value transparency, everything that is possibly to do publicly, I do as an open-source.

----

**BTW I am available to hire since end of February 2023. Do you have interesting PHP application architecture problems to solve, need helping hand with CI/CD or just want to chat? [Let me know!](mailto:j.mikes@me.com)**

### Daily routine

- Technical debt challenges aka cleaning legacy PHP code 🧹  
- Containers 🐳   
- Continuous integration & Continuous delivery (I love Gitlab CI!)
- Helping others with their struggles

In my spare time (really not much of it nowadays 😅), I am building [Peon](https://peon.dev) - [check out on Github](https://github.com/peon-dev/peon). Open-source tool to automate your boring stuff - you can delegate things like coding standards, fixers and many more (well, basically anything, that can run in CLI) to Peon. You can as well choose from predefined ready-to-use community maintained recipes to improve your codebase. Peon behaves just like your real colleague:

1. You: tell peon what to do (define custom tasks and/or pick recipes)
2. Peon: does the job, opens merge request
3. You: review & merge
