Hi, I am **Jan** üëã PHP geek from Czech Republic.  
It has been over 20 years already, since I deployed my first web application!

I love to share my experience and talk about stuff like CI/CD, containers, TDD, DDD, PHP applications architecture, automation, monorepos and many more... Because I highly value transparency, everything that is possibly to do publicly, I do as an open-source.

In the evenings (in the spare time), with my wife we are building [MySpeedPuzzling.com](https://github.com/myspeedpuzzling/myspeedpuzzling.com) - fully open-sourced community platform for all puzzle lovers, focused on speed-puzzlers and full of challenges. It is the place where puzzlers can track, share and compare their times - compete against other speed puzzlers.

In my spare spare time (haha,.. really not much of it nowadays ü•≤), I am building Peon - [check out on Github](https://github.com/peon-dev/peon). Open-source tool to automate your boring stuff - you can delegate things like coding standards, fixers and many more (well, basically anything, that can run in CLI) to Peon. You can as well choose from predefined ready-to-use community maintained recipes to improve your codebase. Peon behaves just like your real colleague:

1. You: tell peon what to do (define custom tasks and/or pick recipes)
2. Peon: does the job, opens merge request
3. You: review & merge
